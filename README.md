Cyberpunk 2077 Breach Protocol Brute Force Solver is a program that solve Breach Protocol minigames in Cyberpunk 2077 by giving the most optimal solution available. This program uses a brute-force approach, meaning it finds all the possible solutions firsthand then searches for the solution which outputs the highest points. <br />
<br />
Components of this game include:
1. Token - consisting of two alphanumeric characters such as E9, BD, and 55.
2. Matrix - consisting of tokens that will be selected to form a code sequence.

4. A token in the buffer can be used in more than one sequence.
5. Each sequence has a varying reward or prize weight.
6. Sequences have a minimum length of two tokens.
